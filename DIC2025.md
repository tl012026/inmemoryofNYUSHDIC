## INTRODUCTION

New York University Shanghai Digital Innovation Challenge (NYUSHDIC) is a tech-based innovation competition hosted by a student organization NYUSH Digital Innovation Community. Students from NYUSH and other universities are welcome to form cross-disciplinary teams, utilize cutting-edge digital technology, and pitch innovative ideas to address real-world problems.  This year, with the competition theme ‚ÄúDigital Innovation Empowering Personalized Education‚Äù, NYUSHDIC collaborates with NYUSH Computer Science, Data Science and Engineering, and Frontiers Science Center of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. 

Different from previous years, we hope to use the mode of participation of enterprises in some selected groups to make the students' projects closer to industrial reality, so that the students' projects are not only restricted to the competition, but also a project that can allow them to continue to internship or other forms of in-depth cooperation with enterprises after the competition, and to make the project a project that can be landed and can produce social value. We aim to empower our participants to explore the vast creative possibilities in some tracks designed by some enterprises, apply their computer science skills to develop impactful solutions, and acquire invaluable insights and skills to navigate future challenges in the digital era, benefiting both participants themselves and society.
